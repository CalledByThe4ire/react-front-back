==================
React Conditionals:
==================

- when you want to pick between showing two things:
    {boolean ? thing_1 : thing_2}

- thing_1 can be straight up JSX or another component

- when you want to pick between showing one thing or not:
    {boolean && thing_1}

===========================
Class/Functional Components:
===========================

- in class-based constructor inside component, use 'this.state = {}' for init after super
- without constructor, then you can just use 'state = {}'

- functional components:
const ComponentName = (props) => {
    return (
        // JSX in here
    );
}

ComponentName.propTypes = {
    ....
}

- props can be destructured as ({thingy1, thingy2}) => ...

======
Random:
======

- import STUFF from 'library' does the default import
- import { SubSTUFF } from 'library' does custom import

- react-dom-router has Switch, Route, and Link
- Switch holds all the routes (I think), you can embed components within the routes
- Link allows to direct to other routes without using the <a> tag
- can get params from the URL using 'match.params'

==================
Hooks: Context API
==================

- I think useState and useEffect are pretty straightforward
