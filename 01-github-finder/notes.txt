React Conditionals
------------------

- when you want to pick between showing two things:
    {boolean ? thing_1 : thing_2}

- thing_1 can be straight up JSX or another component

- when you want to pick between showing one thing or not:
    {boolean && thing_1}

- in class-based constructor inside component, use 'this.state = {}' for init after super
- without constructor, then you can just use 'state = {}'
