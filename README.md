## React Front Back

This is a repository for the files used in learning React in Brad Traversy's [React Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/modern-react-front-to-back/) course on Udemy. I am a novice React programmer hoping to improve my React skills and learn about hooks, contect, and Redux properly. Feel free to use any of this code or contact me if you have questions.
